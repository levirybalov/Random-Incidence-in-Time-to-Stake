# Random-Incidence-in-Time-to-Stake

This Jupyter notebook explains random incidence in time to stake. Random incidence is when an observer observes some process at a random point in time. In this particular case, the process is staking in Proof-of-Stake protocols, and the object of interest is the time that it takes to stake.
