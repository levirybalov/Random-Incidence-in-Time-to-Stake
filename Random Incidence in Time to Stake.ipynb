    "This explanation of random incidence in time to stake presumes some basic knowledge of how Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies operate. For more information, see [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357510506_Expected_Time_to_Stake_and_Net_Weight_in_Proof-of-Stake_Cryptocurrencies). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this explanation, all UTXOs that are mentioned should be assumed to be online and attempting to stake blocks, that the pool of UTXOs does not change, and the effects of cooldown are ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider some UTXO. During every block formation, that UTXO has a probability of staking $p$ equal to $\\frac{\\text{value of UTXO}}{\\text{value of all UTXOs}}$, and the repeated trials constitute a Bernoulli process with parameter $p$. This implies that the probability mass function of the number of trials (block formations) between one stake and another is geometric with parameter $p$. Due to the memorylessness of the geometric distribution, this will be true for every *inter-stake interval*, which is the time between stakes, and in this case is measured in units of blocks. For the purposes of this explanation, we will refer to inter-stake intervals as *inter-arrival times*, which is the commonly used terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for the UTXO, the expected inter-arrival time is $\\frac{1}{p}$, since the distribution is geometric. However, from the point of view of the owner of the UTXO, the expected *observed* inter-arrival time will be almost double the expected inter-arrival time, due to a phenomenon called *random incidence*. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this intuitively, consider the following example. Your friend is sitting in a room, flipping a coin that lands on heads with some probability $p_c$; let's say for simplicity that $p_c = \\frac{1}{2}$. If the coin lands on heads, then your friend waits 99 minutes, and then flips the coin again. If the coin lands on tails, then your friend waits 1 minute, and then flips the coin again. From the perspective of your friend, the average waiting time will be $p_c \\cdot 99 + p_c \\cdot 1 = 50$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that you open the door, and observe your friend during one of the waiting periods. What is the expected waiting time that you observe? Well, $99\\%$ of the time, your friend will be in a waiting period of $99$ minutes, and $1\\%$ of the time, your friend will be in a waiting period of $1$ minute. Thus, the expected waiting time you will see is $0.99 \\cdot 99 + 0.01 \\cdot 1 = 98.02$ minutes, which is almost twice as long as the average waiting time of $50$ minutes that your friend experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is called random incidence. [Here's someone much smarter than me explaining the same concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS1o7uTaLF0).\n",
    "\n",
    "A very similar phenomenon occurs when staking. If you randomly observe a UTXO while it is trying to stake, you are much more likely to observe a time interval between stakes that is longer than the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the actual scenario, since the number of trials/blocks it takes to stake is geometrically distributed, the support of the distribution is $\\mathbb{Z}^+$. That is, unlike in the example just cited, it can take any positive integer number of trials to finally stake.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the following observation has been adapted from the MITx course [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, the expected inter-arrival time is $\\frac{1}{p}$. However, the expected observed inter-arrival time is different. Let $X$ denote the random variable corresponding to the number of blocks/trials until a stake, and let $t_i$ denote $i$ number of blocks/trials. Then probability of the UTXO taking $t_i$ blocks/trials to stake is\n",

In order to build an intuition for the following calculation, suppose that all inter-arrival times are equally likely, and that there are $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ possible interarrival times.
